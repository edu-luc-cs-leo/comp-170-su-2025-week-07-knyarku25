## Week 06 Reflection

After looking at my code and comparing it to the instructor’s version, I saw some important differences in how things were structured and explained. While my version worked, there were a few areas where I could have made improvements, especially when it comes to clarity and following instructions more closely.

One of the main things I noticed was that I used `open()` and `close()`, while the instructor used `with open()`. Using `with` is cleaner and helps avoid leaving files open by mistake, so that’s something I will start doing moving forward.

Another big thing was that I did not include any comments in my code. The instructor's solution had comments that made it easier to understand the steps and logic, especially in the `apply_markup` function. I will make sure to add more comments in the future to show that I understand what my code is doing.

I also left out type hints. They may seem minor, but they help make the code more readable and show what kind of data is expected. That’s another detail I’ll pay closer attention to going forward.

In terms of logic, my `apply_markup` function worked but was more complicated than it needed to be. The instructor's version handled special cases better and was easier to follow. That helped me realize that writing clean, readable code matters just as much as getting it to work.

Lastly, I did test my code. Some small issues could’ve been caught earlier. The professor’s output was better formatted, and it showed the importance of doing test runs.

Overall, this assignment was a good reminder to test my code properly, write helpful comments, and stick to the assignment rules. I plan to keep improving how I organize and explain my code in the next few assignments.
